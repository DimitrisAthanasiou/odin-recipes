    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package kasseri cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water, or as needed</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brandy, at room temperature</li>
        <li>½ lemon, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly chopped Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Brush each side of kasseri cheese with water; <br>
        dredge both sides in flour, making sure the surface is completely covered.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Preheat a well-seasoned cast iron skillet on medium-high heat until smoking; pour in olive oil. <br>
        Carefully place floured cheese in hot oil and cook until cheese begins to ooze and a golden-brown crust forms, about 2 minutes. Quickly flip cheese over with a spatula. Fry until the bottom is golden brown, about 30 seconds more.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Remove from the heat and place skillet onto a napkin-lined plate. Pour brandy into the skillet over the cheese. <br>
        Light the brandy using a fireplace lighter. Squeeze some lemon juice on top to extinguish the last few flames and garnish with parsley.</p>
